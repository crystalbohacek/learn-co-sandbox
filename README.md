Congratulations! You are now able to understand how Javascript interacts with websites through the DOM. That's a big deal. Take a few seconds, breathe in, breath out and realize that you now know something you didn't before. Only a few lessons ago, you didn't even know what the DOM was. Now you understand how to manipulate it.

Perspective

If you ever want to show your friends something cool, open up the console on any web page and then find the selector for an element, then modify it using Javascript in the console. Prepare to enjoy the shock and awe of your friends!

From DOM Manipulation to Programming Logic
For the rest of this material, we will be moving from the basics of DOM manipulation to the meat and potatoes of programming. This means we are going to cover the ideas of conditionals, looping, encapsulation and syntax. I know those may not be familiar to you, but over the next few lessons they will become second nature! Remember when DOM was a scary word? Encapsulation will soon go the way of the DOM. You're going to be encapsulating everything.

Really the goal of the rest of this course is to introduce you to programmatic thinking. We will be doing that through explaining Javascript, but the goal of every student we serve at The Flatiron School is to teach programmatic thinking as a general way to solve problems. These problems may be creating the next Facebook, or it may be just solving the best order to complete your errands. You'll notice programmatic, logical thinking starting to permeate throughout your decision process. It's incredibly powerful and something that has aided millions of programmers to solve some of the hardest problems in the world.

That is the goal with this class. While we may touch on making pictures of cats spin, we want you to internalize the thought process required to solve that silly problem. Hopefully, you'll go off after this class and solve some slightly more important problems :)

Javascript Outside of the Browser
You've spent some time in the browser with Javascript. That's great. Now let's get to where Javascript has been rapidly increasing its programming market share: outside of the browser. You may have heard of it, but a new tool called NodeJS was created a few years back to allow developers to write Javascript code outside of the browser. That is what we are going to use now to be able to go deep on programmatic thinking, without having to explain complicated browser interactions. We want to simplify programming down to its most core elements.

Hello World
Let's write your first code using NodeJS and non-browser Javascript. To do this, we are going to remove your first set of training wheels. We are no longer going to be using the CodePens that we've been using before. We are going to use a real developer environment through the Learn IDE.

Training Wheels

To launch the Learn IDE, click the blue Open button at the top of this page. This should download the lesson to your IDE and open the IDE. If you need to re-download the IDE, you can do so here.

Now open the "js-from-dom-to-node" folder on the left folder viewer pane and then select the file index.js. IT'S CODING TIME.

First thing is first, I want to show you that everything we will do in the IDE, you can do in the Console. First, return to your browser, right click and select Inspect. Then make sure the Console is selected and type console.log("Hello, World!") and press Enter. You should see "Hello, World!" printed right below your line of code. Congrats! You just wrote your first line of browser-less code. All this does is print out whatever is in between the parenthesis.

Let's bring that code over to our index.js file on the IDE. Make sure you are in the index.js file in the js-from-dom-to-node folder. Once in there go ahead and paste the following code in there:

console.log("Hello, World!")


You've opened the IDE Sandbox. ðŸŽ‰

The Sandbox is an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code when you're not working on a "lab" (labs open the IDE In Browser).

The work you do in the Sandbox will be saved from lesson to lesson, and is automatically saved on your behalf to a repository in your GitHub account called `learn-co-sandbox`.

Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub, as it will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of sync.

To learn more about the Sandbox, please visit http://help.learn.co/ide-in-browser#sandbox.
